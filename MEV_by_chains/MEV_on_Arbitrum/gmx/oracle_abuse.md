## gmx oracle abuse


<br>

### tl; dr

<br>


* october'22 oracle abuse: [the thesis](https://twitter.com/joshua_j_lim/status/1571554171395923968) was that while the gmx team runs bots to update prices by making calls to SetPriceWithBit(), mev operators can observe these price updates in the mempool before they are on-chain.
* also in october'22, a [new oracle was deployed (XGET)](https://twitter.com/Kalcrypto1/status/1576977723016085505), allowing for information to be verified on-chain while providing frontrunning resistance (by having nodes sign a combination of blockhashes and values).
