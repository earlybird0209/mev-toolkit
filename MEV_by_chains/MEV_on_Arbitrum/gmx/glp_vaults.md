## delta neutral strategies and glp vaults

<br>

### vaults

<br>

* vaults are suites of trustless defi strategies to generate delta-minimized returns on $GLP assets (gmx's lp token, which receives 70% of gmx's fee revenue). 
* vaults can provide liquidity on gmx to collect yield from $GLP. they are also the counterparty to margin traders (benefiting from trader losses). 
* vault should be backtested against months of real-world market data (including edge cases), usually with a baseline such as a standalone usdc vault
* hedges are algorithmically rebalanced at regular intervals. hedging on gmx incurs fees for minting and burning of $GLP, opening and closing positions, and funding for open interest.

<br>

### delta neutral strategies

<br>

* delta neutral strategies offset volatility so that GLP owners win yields while also not having to worry about price changes.
* this is usally achieved with shorting its underlying assets or hedging the positions, and the positions must be constantly changed based on the weight of the assets.


<br>

### pool exposures

<br>

* the first component of a pool are the available assets, which are the vault assets minus reserved assets (assets set aside to cover longs).
* by covering longs, a reserved $BTC that would move with $BTC is used to cover a long position by surrendering all the upside gains to the counterparty (but also taking all collaterals of the counterparty when the price of $BTC goes down).
* conversely, a short against the pool becomes a synthetic long as its credit gains to the pool when the price goes up (but takes money from the pool when the price goes down).
* hedging $GLP means taking short positions, either on GMX or on a CEX. The short pays when the directional asset goes down, and loses when the opposite happens.
* the spread of hedged $GLP over $ETH is a good measure of $GLP's performance, and why a hedged strategy might be a better holding strategy that minimises volatility.
