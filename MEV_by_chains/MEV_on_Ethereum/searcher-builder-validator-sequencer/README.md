## Notes on Searcher-Builder-Validator/Sequencer (SBV)

<br>

### tl; dr

* cooperation between proposers seems unlike in an unfair market, especially in a semi-permissionless half-centralized sequencer setup
* considering slashing risks, the incentives to become a sequencer (despite tx fees) are unclear
* having a Searcher-Builder-Validator/Sequencer supply chain could lead to trusted social contracts between all actors
* should MEV be addressed on the application layer? this generate security concerns on the underlying protocol
* a fair marketplace would let searchers to look for predictable MEV state changes with profitable actions, with the security of the protocol (with the sequencer itself)
