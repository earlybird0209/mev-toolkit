### tl; dr

<br>

* the [shapella upgrade](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/03/28/shapella-mainnet-announcement) is a hard fork that happened on april/12/2023 and added changed to the execution layer (shanghai), consensus layer (capella), and the engine API, being the last piece of the puzzle that marks the completion of ethereumâ€™s transition to pos. 
* To make it possible to unlock their staked ETH, shapella introduces `BLSToExecutionChange` (BTEC) message to the consensus layer, which allows validators to set the execution address for withdrawals. the beacon chain can only process a maximum of 16 withdrawals per block, with the limit in place to maintain network security.
