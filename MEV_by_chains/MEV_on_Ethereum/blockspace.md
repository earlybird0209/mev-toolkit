## blockspace derivatives

<br>

### risks examples

#### nft launches

* a big project could increase demand for blockspace, so gas prices would spike during these mints. actors could buy a lot of blockspace derivatives for said date.


#### block size manipulation

* if a block is larger than the target block size, the base fee increases. a block builder can manipulate the size of the block to increase/decrease the base fee in the next block.
