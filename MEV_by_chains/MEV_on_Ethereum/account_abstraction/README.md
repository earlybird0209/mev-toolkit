## ERC-4337: account abstraction

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* this change implements censorship-resistant account abstraction without making any changes to the consensus layer of ethereum, by creating a new mempool, a smart contract wallet standard, and a shared entry point contract for managing user operations.
* this enables wallets to have multi-sigs, social recovery, hardware enclaves, etc.
* **UserOperations** are pseudo-transactions objects that represent a user's intent.
* **Bundlers** are new actors that are either block builders, or users that can send transactions to block builders through a bundle marketplace. they package up a set of objects into a tx making a call to a special contract and sending objects to a separate mempool.
* the **EntryPoint** is a smart contract that receives **UserOperations** from **Bundlers**.
* Aggregators combines multiple signatures into a single signature, to validate multiple **UserOperatons** in one step.
* **Smart contract account** are the target of the **UserOperation** and will validate and execute the **UserOperation**.
* **Paymaster** create flexibility for how gas is paid and by whom.
