## block builders on ethereum

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* block builders have the same 3 sources of tx as validators did before the merge. they can:
    1. act as searchers and include their own MEV-extracting transactions.
    2. include txs submitted to them privately, including those submitted by external searchers (through a "bribe" through either coinbase payments or `txsFees`).   
    3. include pending tx broadcasted in the public mempool
* `blockValue` = `txFees` + MEV
* builders will aggregate txs from users, MEV searchers, and own private order flow to make the highest value blocks possible
* builders having its blocks included consistently incentivizes more private order flow (searchers want their tx included)
* builder can be selling future blockspace upfront so market makers or protocols can secure block space for their transactions or users
