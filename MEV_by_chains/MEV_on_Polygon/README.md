### tl; dr

<br>

* reduced gas fees resulted in large bot-spamming attacks 
* for frontrunning, backrunning, or sandwiching to succeed, the bot's tx needs to land right before or behind the victim's, respectively. bots cannot choose the ordering so they need to set gas fees in a way the txs land in the right place (usually by spamming).
