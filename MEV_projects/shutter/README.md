### tl; dr

<br>

* shutter plans to encrypt txs using threshold cryptography on ethereum and l2s.
* shutter dao hires nodes called keypers, which generate cryptographic keys with which users encrypt their txs
* keypers act as a set of nodes that encrypt and decrypt txs in a decentralized manner. txs are fully encrypted until the order of the txs in a block is finalized.
