### tl; dr

<br>

* on cosmos, txs are processed "first come first server", which prevents frontrunning and sandwich attacks but incentivizes searchers to spam the network when profitable mev opportunies are found.
* skip is creating a marketplace where searchers can submit bundles for quicker execution at the cost of a fee (which is redistributed to validators and user).
