## liquidation

<br>

### tl, dr

<br>

* **lending protocol** work by requiring users to deposit some collateral. users can then borrow different assets and tokens from others depending on what they need, up to a certain amount of their deposited collateral. as the value of a borrower's collateral fluctuates, if the value of the borrowed assets exceeds the value of the collateral, the protocol allows anyone to liquidate the collateral (similar to margin calls in traditional finance). 
* **liquidation** happens when a user buys someone's collateral (at a discount) when the value of borrowed asset exceeds a predetermined value relative to the asset deposited as collateral.
* **searchers compete** to parse blockchain data as fast as possible to determine which borrowers can be liquidated and be the first to submit a liquidation transaction and collect the liquidation fee.
* **example of strategy**: bot detects a liquidation opportunity at a block and issues a liquidation tx, which is expected to be included in the next block. to compete with other liquidators, the bot sets high tx fees for their liquidation tx.
* **another strategy**: bot observes a tx that will create a liquidation opportunity (e.g., an oracle price update tx rendering a collateralized debit to be liquidated), then backruns this tx with a liquidation tx to avoid the fee bidding competition.
