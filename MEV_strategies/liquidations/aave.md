## aave protocol

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* decentralized lending protocol that lets users lend or borrow crypto assets or real-world assets (RWAs) without going to a centralized intermediary.
* users deposit digital assets into liquidity pools, which become funds so that the protocol can lend out.


<br>

### tl; dr aave v3

<br>

* **portal**: allows flow of liquidity between aave v3 markets across different networks (governance-approved bridges can burn atokens while minting them on the destination network)
* **emode**: the high-efficiency mode allows borrowers to extract the highest borrowing power out of their collateral when supplied + borrowed assets are price-correlated (e.g. both are derivatives of the same underlying asset).
* **isolation mode**: new assets can be listed as isolated so borrowers cannot supply other assets as collateral (but can capture yield) but only approved stablecoins.
* **siloed borrowing** allows assets with risky manipulatable oracles to be listed as a single borrow asset.
* **multiple rewards** per token.
* **chains**: avalanche, pptimism, polygon, fantom, harmony and arbitrum.
