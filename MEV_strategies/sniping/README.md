## sniping

<br>


### tl; dr

<br>

* **liquidity sniping** happens when searchers compete to purchase an asset immediately after the creation of a liquidity pool. 
* tokens are then not off-loaded in the same block, but instead sold over the next minutes or hours. 
* profits for a sniper are not guaranteed.
