## sandwiching

<br>

### tl, dr

<br>

* **sandwich attacks** occurs when a searcher identifies a profitable trade in the mempool that will cause an impact on the price of an asset.

* a searcher buys or sells a calculated amount directly before the large trade is executed and then immediately exits their position after the large order has taken place, banking a profit.

* the main theme of sandwich attacks is the deterministic price slippage caused by available liquidity in the pool, which is deterministic . slipage is the change in the price of an asset during a trade.

* sandwiches (and most frontruns) are often labelled **toxic mev** because the tx that is frontrun either executes at worse conditions or fails to execute.

* a softer side of sandwich is on the lens of economic efficiency, on which an order can create a consumer surplus and the absence of a [nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium). the bot operator would love the economic system back.
