## frontrunning 

<br>

### tl, dr

<br>


* frontrunning is the process by which an adversary observes txs on the network layer and then acts upon this information by, for instance, issuing a competing tx, with the hope that this tx is mined before a victim's tx.

* **strategy example**: transaction A is broadcasted with a higher gas price than an already pending transaction B so that A gets mined before B.


* **generalized frontrunners** are bots that watch the mempool to detect profitable transactions, copy their code, replace addresses with theirs, then submit the modified tx with a higher gas price.

* **specialized frontrunners**, also known as longtails, are covered [here](https://github.com/go-outside-labs/mev-toolkit/tree/main/longtails)
