## arbitrage algorithms (tx-ordering based)

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>


* these algorithms are represented by multi-edged graph data structures where nodes represent coins and edges represents rates.
* to find an arb opportunity, find a closed loop of edges for which the product of weights in the edges > 1.
