## latency optimization

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>


#### builders

* builders might delay before proposing a full block to maximize the amount of potential mev for inclusion in the block. this requires extremely low latency for proposing blocks and views of the mempool.

<br>

#### searcher

##### compute latency

* transaction parsing and filtering
* simulation


##### transport latency

* sending bundles to builder
* builder rate limits


##### searcher responses

* proprietary compute improvements
* bundle timing in slot periods
* co-locate with builder (searching in the same region, etc.)
