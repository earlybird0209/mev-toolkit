## inverse finance

### tl; dr


<br>

* [inverse finance](https://www.inverse.finance/) is building a suite of DeFi tools that are governed by the inverse finance dao.
* the first product was DCA (dollar cost average) vaults, but the DAO decided to put all resources toward anchor and their synthetic stablecoin DOLA. xDOLA has liquidity pools on curve, balancer, velodrome (optimism), and Sushi. curve and balancer amms are the most significant “stability mechanisms”, as there is almost no exogenous collateral backing the stablecoin.
* anchor (later renamed to Frontier) is a lending market (mostly a fork of Compound). 
* now, fixed-rate money market (FiRM) is an improved version of frontier with additional features, increased security, and a new primitive to facilitate fixed-rate borrowing of DOLA.
* inverse suffered from two exploits in 2022 (~$15.6M and ~$5.8M) 2022, due to oracle price manipulation.
