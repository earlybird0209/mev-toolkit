## uniswap v3

<br>

### tl; dr

<br> 

- uniswap v3 introduced: 

  * **concentrated liquidity** and **non-fungible liquidity**: 
    * replacing fungible ERC20 liquidity positions with non-fungible ERC-721 liquidity positions. 
    * individual LPs get granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. 
    * individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against.
  * **multiple fee tiers**: allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk. 
  * **range orders**: lps can deposit a single token in a custom price range, above or below the current price.
  * **improvements to the TWAP oracle**: possible to calculate any recent TWAP within ~9 days in a single on-call chain.

- new strategies:
  * creating and closing LP positions can be a form of trading. range orders can be used as either buy-limit or take-profit orders.
