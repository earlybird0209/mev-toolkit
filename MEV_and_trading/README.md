## trading and defi 

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* in november/2018, uniswap v1 was published to ethereum mainnet as the first amm for defi.
* in july/2019, synthetix creates a sETH/ETH liquidity pool on uniswap, enabling users to earn yield by adding liquidity.
* in 2020, eth drops more than 30% due to the pandemic, with a wave of liquidations by users' ETH collateral losing value, but it ignites the defi summer and all the nice things after.
