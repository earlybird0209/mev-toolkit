## options

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* **options can be used to speculate on the future price and volatility of an asset, and to manage risks in a portfolio.**
* options can be thought of as "insurance-like" contracts where one pays a premium upfront. profits come from "disaster events", with **capped losses** and **unlimited upsides**.
* purchasers of options receive the **right** to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined **strike price**. **option chains** list **calls** (ability to buy the asset) and **puts** (ability to sell the asset) for a given expiration across a variety of **strikes**.
* options also gives leverage by chasing cheaper premiums (e.g. shortening expirations).
* options contracts contain the following information:
  - nature of the right: from the option buyersâ€™ perspective, to buy (call) or sell (put) the asset.
  - specification and quantity of underlying asset (e.g., 1 BTC).
  - strike (or exercise) price: the price paid or received for the asset if the option is exercised. 
  - expiration date: the last date the option can be exercised.
  - rules for exercise and settlement.
