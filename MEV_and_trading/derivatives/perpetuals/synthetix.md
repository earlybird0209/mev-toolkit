* one of ethereum's ecosystem's leading derivatives projects.
* a derivative liquidity protocol that powers the creation of "synths" (synthetic assets) that can be traded in a decentralized and permissionless manner.
* synths let traders capitalize on exposure to assets without having to directly own the assets in question.
* some of Synthetix's most popular synths are its forex synths: sUDS and sEUR.
* a foundational element of Synthetix is SNX staking, which is used for collateralizing the derivatives protocol and for creating deep liquidity for synths.
* SNX stakers earn inflationary SNX rewards and a cut of sUSD fees generated by protocols that work on top of Synthetix.

    * The primary DEX in the Synthetix ecosystem.
    * Designed to facilitate zero-slippage synth trading.
    * it does not rely on an orderbook or liquidity pool model, but instead the DEX employs a peer-to-contract system in which synths are traded against a smart contract informed by Chainlink price feeds.
