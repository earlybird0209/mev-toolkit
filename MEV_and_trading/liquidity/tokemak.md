### tl; dr

<br>


* decentralized market making platform that allows liquidity flow, designed to generate liquidity for defi and future tokenized dapps. 
* reactors are 2 pools: host staked assets on each side of the pools, one reactor is the pair reactor, the other is the token reactor. participants are LP (providing assets), liquidity directors (direct assets), and pricers (third party pricers for non-AMM venues).
* tokemak locks up $ETH and $USDC which are base tokens that any pool could be built on, users deposit these base assets for APR paid out in $TOKE.
* tokemak protocol is called C.o.R.E (Collateralization of Reactors Event) secure token reactors on the platform by placing bribes using a bribe marketplace called hidden hand. $TOKE holders secure their share of the bribes by using their voting power to vote on particular reactors. $TOKE can be thought of as tokenized liquidity.
* impermanent loss protection through a mitigation waterfall: the protocol pulls the required asset from its reserve and ensures 1:1 withdrawals for the asset and the asset's t token. in the pair reactors, the protocol pulls the asset from their "treasure" from either fees or swapping.
