## stablecoins 101

<br>

#### fiat-collateralized stablecoins 

<br>

* fiat-collateralized stablecoins are stablecoins that are backed by fiat currencies like the US dollar. 
* their reserves are held by a central entity. The most popular fiat-backed stablecoins at this time are USDC, USDT, and BUSD.Â 
* their main weakness is centralization as the collateral of a fiat-collateralized stablecoin is held by one independent party.
* e.g., Circle's USDC, iFinex's USDT, and Binances BUSD

<br>

#### cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins

<br>

*  while crypto-backed stablecoins are good for their decentralization, they are capital inefficient (overcollaterized)
*  eg: MakerDAO's DAI, Synthetix's sUSD, and Liquity's LUSD

<br>

#### decentralized (algorithmic) stablecoins

<br>

*  they maintain their peg without having to directly collateralize the issuance. 
* they rely on supply-and-demand algorithms to maintain price stability ðŸ˜¬.
* e.g., FRAX, RAI and rip FEI and UST
