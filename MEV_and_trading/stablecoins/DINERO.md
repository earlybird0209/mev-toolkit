### tl; dr

* [Redacted] Cartel started as an OHM-fork, generating +$100MM in treasure, and then creating an ecosystem of products.
* $DINERO is their upcoming stablecoin with collateralized debit position (cdp) and peg stability module (psm).
* this means you can deposit $ETH or $pxETH (ther LSD) to take out loans in $DINERO (ie, CDP). with PSM, the protocol will always sell or buy $DINERO for $1 and arbitrageurs will maintain the peg.
* redacted cartel is building their own relayer with 2 features: protect from mev and accept $DINERO as gas payment.
* the relayers can be validated by dinero protocol validators (where their lsd strategy comes in).
