## usdd stablecoin

<br>

* usdd is an over-collaterized stablecoin issued on the tron blokchain
* initially a copycat of ust, pivoted to an over-collateralization model after terra's crash
* it's not permissionless or decentralized
* it can only enter circulation via a 5-of-7 multsig controlled by members of the tron dao reserve (tdr)
* circulation supply ($725M) hasn't changed since july 2022
* trx backing the circulating usdd accounts for 85% of its value, and it has added reserves in btc, usdt, and usdc
* usdd has two stability mechanisms: a peg stability module (psm) and four monetary policy instruments (mpi)
* the team behind usdd is anonymous
* for cross-chain transactions, usdd uses the BitTorrent network, a cross-chain bridge protocol (bought by justin sun in 2018)
