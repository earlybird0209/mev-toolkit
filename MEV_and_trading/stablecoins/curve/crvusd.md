## crvUSD

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* decentralized stablecoin issued by curve, with a novel mechanism known as lending-liquidating amm algorithm (llama)
* llama employs a kinder liquidation design that swaps a user's collateral into crvUSD as its value decreases (rather than fully liquidating a user's position in one fell swoop)
