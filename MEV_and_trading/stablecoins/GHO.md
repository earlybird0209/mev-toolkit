## aave's gho

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* GHO is a decentralized stablecoin issued by aave.
* it's overcollaterized as it's backed by deposits in aave v3 (users mint directly into the money market)
* rather than having interest rates determined algorithmically like other assets in aave, its borrow rate will be manually set by governance, giving aave total control over the cost to mint/borrow gho.
