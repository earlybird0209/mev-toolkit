* area in the chart moving sideways
* we can use consolidation as a guide for our entry/exit points

* use these levels for our stop loss levels

##### support and resistance

* support and resistance are simply significant price levels
* resistance can become support if a price breaks through that level in an uptrend
* vice versa for a downtrend


##### moving averages

* SMA: arithmetic mean of prices over a given time period
* EMA: weighted and give more importance to recent prices

##### relative strength index (RSI)

* plots the relative strength of the price compared to previous prices
* momentum indicator
* above 70: price is relatively expensive (overbought)
* below 30: price is relatively cheap (oversold)
* can't predict how the price will change in the future

##### average true range

* measure of daily price volatility
* tell us the true amount the price could move in a given day
* largest probably move for one day based on previous data
* can be used to set our stop loss and give the trade some breathing room

### how to trade with trends

<br>

1. Identify the market trends
2. Ask where are the main areas of trade
   - where is support and resistance?
   - any chart pattern?
3. Make your entry based on the daily trade action
   - is the candlestick telling us that the trade will go in the direction of our trade?
   - is the trade bullish or bearish based of candlestick patterns?
