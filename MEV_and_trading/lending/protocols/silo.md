### tl; dr

<br>

* as opposed to shared-pool protocols such as aave or compound, silo uses an isolated-pool approach where every token asset has its own lending market and is paired against the bridge assets ETH and silo's overcollaterized stablecoin XAI.
* lenders in all protocols are exposed to the risk of eth and xai. since all tokens are paired with eth or xai, there is only a single market for every token asset, preventing fractured liquidity and allowing protocol efficiency.
