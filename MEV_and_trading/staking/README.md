## staking

### updates

<br>

* 04.01.23: new entrants: binance's $BETH, origin protocol's $OETH, and yearn's $yETH (already pursing a gauge vote for the curve pool).
  * curve is offering CRV rewards to users for staking wBETH/ETH LP tokens.
  * $OETH has an interesting design mechanism, minted using other LSDs as collateral: Lido's $stETH, Rocket Pool’s $rETH, and Frax’s $frxETH. the yield is dependent on the $OETH pool receiving Curve rewards.
  * $yETH is an Ethereum token backed by a basket of LSDs
