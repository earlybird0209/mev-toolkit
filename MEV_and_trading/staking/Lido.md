### tl; dr

<br>

* Lido finance is a liquid staking protocol that offers its services to Ethereum, Terra, Solana, Kusama, and Polygon.
* It's governed by the Lido DAO through the LDO governance token.
* Lido's first product was liquid staking for ETH 2.0 deposits on the beacon chain. It allowed users access to ETH 2.0 staking without the 32 ETH deposit requirement and gave them a composable tokenized representation of their staking deposit, stETH.
* Lido uses a single token model, stETH that represents users' staking deposits. stETH is minted at 1:1 ratio of ether deposited into the Lido platform.
* Staking rewards accrue to the stETH token through a daily rebasing mechanism.
* 10% fee on accrued staking rewards that is evenly split between the Lido DAO and node operators.
* q1/23 stats: inflow of 1.09mil eth staked, market share to 72.3%, fees generated: $117mil, $LDOUSD + 152% (second largest fee generating protocol after uniswap)
